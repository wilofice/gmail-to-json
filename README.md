# gmail-to-json
Export all your Gmail emails to JSON

I personally find Gmail API to be a bit confusing for beginners. The APIâ€™s wizard comes handy to create the project, get credentials, and authenticate them. However, the process that should be followed after that is not mentioned clearly.

Therefore, I have created a Python script that does the following:
1. Scrapes all emails from your mailbox
2. Exports all emails to JSON file which includes (Datetime, Sender, Subject, Content)
3. Email content is formatted using bs4
4. Filter emails by their labels ('IMPORTANT', 'INBOX', 'PROMOTIONS', ...)


## Installation

Before anything, make sure to create a project at https://console.developers.google.com/project and 
create a credential for your app/project. Save/Download the generated credentials.json file in the same directory where you saved 'scraper.py'. If not, set the correct file path in the script here,
This youtube video shows how to do it: [link]

```python
flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file('credentials.json', SCOPES)
```

1. Run the script to install the necessary packages
```
bash install.sh
```
Then

2. Run scraper.py
```
python scraper.py
```

3. Modify these lines to filter the emails and set a maximum number of emails to download
```python
mailFunc.get_msgids_with_labels(label_ids=['IMPORTANT'], max_results = 15)
```

4. Uncomment these lines from 106 to 114  in 'mailhelpers.py' to download all the emails in your inbox
